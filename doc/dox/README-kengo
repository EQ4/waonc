What is WaoN?

   WaoN is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, that is, the inverse of '
   timidity' (and its descendants timidity++, and timidity with Gtk+).
   ("WaoN" also has a meaning of harmony of notes or chord in Japanese!)
   My original intention is to pick up voicing of harmony from sound of
   my favorite pianists. (I have no talent to do so, but computer will
   :-) But there is no functional application of this kind on Unix
   platform, as far as I know. So that I start writing WaoN by myself.
   WaoN is released under the GNU General Public License.
   
Features

     * read wav file and write standard MIDI file format 0.
     * stdin/stdout can be used as input/output file.
     * no explicit limits of number of notes at a time or along the time.
     * patch file (wav) can be used.
     * pitch shift.
       
Platform

   I believe that WaoN is generic, but developed on FreeBSD.
   
Formats

   WaoN's native format as sound-input is WAV, and that as note-output is
   standard MIDI format 0. If you have SoX, you can use almost all sound
   format as input. In addition, if you have timidity or some midi player
   which could read standard MIDI file from stdin, you can play resultant
   midi file on time. See also Tips.

Example:

$ ./waon -i duet-suite.wav -n 1024 -p piano1.wav -r 1
WaoN : Reading Wave file: Microsoft PCM format,
        1 channel, 11025 samp/sec, 11025 byte/sec, 1 block align,
        8 bits/samp, 9922500 data bytes.
WaoN : Reading Wave file: Microsoft PCM format,
        1 channel, 44100 samp/sec, 88200 byte/sec, 2 block align,
        16 bits/samp, 106848 data bytes.
WaoN : end of file.
WaoN : difference of pitch = -0.077538 ( + 0.000000 )
WaoN : # of notes = 26617

       
TODO

    1. stereo
    2. improve algorithms
    3. give some examples and instructions here
    4. make GUI for WaoN in order to adjust parameters (with Gtk+)
