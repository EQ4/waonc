 * http://www.fftw.org/:
 *
 *    Our benchmarks, performed on on a variety of platforms, show that
 *    FFTW's performance is typically superior to that of other publicly
 *    available FFT software, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned
 *    codes. In contrast to vendor-tuned codes, however, FFTW's
 *    performance is portable: the same program will perform well on most
 *    architectures without modification. Hence the name, "FFTW," which
 *    stands for the somewhat whimsical title of "Fastest Fourier
 *    Transform in the West."

/**
 *    Provides manifest constants for the type of filter window.
 *
 *    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function.
 *
 * @todo
 *    Some of the values are not yet supported.
 *
 * @todo
 *    We should add a triangular window (B-spline k = 2) as well.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_NONE
 *    Provides a rectangular window, also known as the boxcar or Dirichlet
 *    window.  Introduces a wide spread in the spectrum.
 *    One of the B-spline windows (k = 1).
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_PARZEN
 *    The Parzen window, also known as the <i>de la Vall√© Poussin
 *    window</i>.
 *    One of the B-spline windows, of the fourth order (k = 4).
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_WELCH
 *    Provides the Welch window, which forms a single parabolic section.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_HANNING
 *    Provides the Hanning window, a raised cosine window.
 *    This filter window is the default filter window for waon.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_HAMMING
 *    Provides the Hamming windows, a specific type of cosine window.
 *    The window is optimized to minimize the maximum (nearest) side lobe,
 *    giving it a height of about one-fifth that of the Hann window.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_BLACKMAN
 *    Similar to the Hanning/Hamming windows, but provides an even more
 *    narrow frequency representation.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_STEEPER
 *    Provides a steeper 6 30-dB/octave rolloff window.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_MAX
 *    Indicates one greater than the maximum value of this parameter.
 *    Values greater than or equal to this value are currently not
 *    supported.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_NUTTALL
 *    Provides an even more narrow frequency range than the Nuttall
 *    window.  NOT YET SUPPORTED.
 *
 * @var FILTER_WINDOW_TRIANGLE
 *    Provides a triangular window.  NOT YET SUPPORTED.
